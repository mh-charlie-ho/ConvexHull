### Build

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

------

### Run

The polygon is generated by the gaussian.

The arguments are gaussian mean for x and y. So the arrange is **x1, y1, x2, y2**.

```
cd build
./charlie -5 5 -2 8
```
The result is 0, which represents no overlapping. The result is 1, which represents overlapping.

------

### View
```
cd build
python3 gjk/view/visualization.py
```

### Pending 
- Varify the result. (The result is just varified by the visualization tool)
